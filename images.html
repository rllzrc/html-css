    <h1>Images</h1>

    <!--JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes w.out exorbitantly increasing file sz. this makes em great for photos & images w lots of gradients in them but they don't allow for transparent pixels~-->

    <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a href='links.html'>links</a> and <a href='misc/extras.html'>useful extras</a>.</p>

    <!-- !!! added width attribute to all since pixel-based formats needed to be twice as big as ya want em to be esp on retina displays. to get em down to intended size, use width attr. -->
    <!-- the width attribute sets explicit dim3nsion for the img-->

    <!-- UPDATED to have alt attributes to img elements. it defines a text alternatve to the img being displayed, impacting BOTH search engines and ACCESSIBILITY users. always add alt when needed!!!!-->

    <h2>JPGs</h2>

    <p>JPG images are good for photos!</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.jpg' width='75' alt='A mochi ball in a bubble'/>

    <!-- GIFs !!! are the go to option for simple animations, but tradeoff is that theyre somewhat limited in terms of color palette; never use em for photos! transparent pixels are binary option for GIFs, so you cant have semi-opaque pixels. Use PNG instead if you dont need animation ~ -->

    <h2>GIFs</h2>

    <p>GIFs are good for animations! ~</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.gif' width='75' alt='A dancing mochi ball'/>

    <!-- PNGs are great for anything that is NOT a PHOTO or ANIMATED. Excellent for icons, tech diagrams, logos, etc. Same quality for photos but bigger file size but they do deal with opacity just fine and there are NO color palette limitations!-->

    <h2>PNGs</h2>

    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons! Yay!</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.png' width='75' alt='A mochi ball'/>

    <!-- SVGs !!! unlike pixel based image formats as above, this is vector based graphics foramat, so it can scale up or down to ANY dimension w.out loss of quality. WONDERFUL for RESPONSIVE DESIGN. V good for same uses as PNG, use em whenever ya can! ~*~*~ -->

    <h2>SVGs</h2>

    <p>SVGs are <em>AMAZING</em>. Use them whenever ya can, homie!</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.svg' alt='A mochi ball with Bezier handles'/>

    <!-- !!! potential issue w SVG: for it to display consistently across browsers, need to convert any text fields to outlines using image editor >> have a lot of images w text? can have a big impact on file size. for that reason, sometimes PNGs can be better. -->
